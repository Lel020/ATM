The idea is to simulate a person using a real ATM.

Currently, the ATM will be using the Scanner. But after completion of project, I may implement the use of a UI.

The ATM will have the following features:
- Withdrawal
- Deposit
- Balance Inquiry
- Change Pin (after being set)
- Transfer (to another account)
